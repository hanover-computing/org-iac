Infrastructure as Code for org-wide stuff

## Setup

Pull the repo, and run `npm i` to install dependencies and setup the repo for local development.
That installs all of the automatic git hooks that'll format and validate all files in a commit.

(Plus, if you have `nvm` installed, you can use `nvm use` to use the recommended `node` version.)
